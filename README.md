# HOW TO USE

This bot only has two commands right now. 
- !asl calc
- !asl help

## Commands
- calc - Will take all user input and run it through the artefact_calc() func. Return a list of materials needed to the user to completely repair all artefacts provided to the bot.
- help - Will return a message to the user with description of how to use the bot.

## In progress
- ~~Cleaning up the HUGE elif block in artefact_list.py to an item dictionary.~~
- ~~Calculate the amount of experience that will be gained.~~

## To do:
- Display experience seperate from materials.
- Create a way for users to enter items without having to be case sensitive.
- Implement more features such as !asl lvl, and !asl collection.
- Calculate the cost of materials (will need to learn api integration)
